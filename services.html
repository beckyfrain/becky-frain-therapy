          <h2>Counselling Services</h2>
          <p>
            I offer a range of counselling services designed to support you in a way that fits your life. Sessions typically last around 50 minutes and take place at a pace that feels right for you. We will work collaboratively to understand your experiences and help you find a path forward.
          </p>
          <p>Most clients prefer to meet once a week initially, but we can discuss alternatives such as longer sessions or more/less frequent appointments.</p>

          <h2>Individual Counselling</h2>
          <p>
            One‑to‑one sessions provide a private space where you can explore personal challenges, thoughts and emotions. Whether you’re feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, coping with bereavement or wanting to understand patterns in your relationships or identity, individual counselling offers a supportive environment to gain insight and move towards a life that fulfils you.
          </p>
          <p>In‑person sessions can take place in Lymm (Warburton border), Warrington (town centre) or Altrincham (town centre).</p>

          <h2>Online & Telephone Counselling</h2>
          <p>
            For clients who prefer the flexibility of remote sessions or cannot attend in person, I provide counselling via secure video call or telephone. This can be particularly helpful if you have mobility difficulties, live outside the area or simply want to engage in therapy from the comfort of your home.
