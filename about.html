          <h2>About Becky</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Rebecca Frain, a professional counsellor based in Lymm,
            Cheshire. I am passionate about supporting individuals to navigate
            life’s difficulties and believe that everyone deserves a space to be
            heard and understood. My calm and welcoming approach helps clients
            feel safe, valued and empowered to explore their experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold a Diploma in Counselling and am a member of the British
            Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). This means I
            work in accordance with BACP’s ethical framework to ensure the
            highest standards of professional practice. I engage in regular
            supervision and ongoing professional development to continually
            enhance my skills and knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I have worked with adults from diverse
            backgrounds who are dealing with issues such as anxiety, depression,
            grief, trauma, relationship difficulties and life transitions. I
            integrate elements from different therapeutic modalities to suit
            each individual, creating a personalised approach that respects your
            unique needs and goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my counselling work, I enjoy spending time in nature,
            practicing mindfulness and connecting with my local community.
