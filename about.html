          <h2>About Becky</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I’m Becky Frain, a Person Centered Therapist based in Warrington,
            Cheshire. I offer both online and in person counselling sessions in the Warrington and Lymm area.
            After years of trainining and other personal and professional experiences I have the skills 
            and compasssion to create a safe space for you to speak freely about whatever is troubling you, 
            weighing you down or holding you back.   I believe that everyone deserves a space to be
            heard and understood. My warm and welcoming approach helps clients to feel safe, 
            valued and empowered to explore their experiences.

            I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opporunity to train as a counsellor.  It has changed my life.   
            It is an absolute priviledge to walk alongside clients as they navigate through their past and present
            to move to living life in a way they want and deserve. 

            Choosing a counsellor is incredibly important.  I would recommend you have an introductory call with any 
            potential counsellor to get a sense of who they are and whether you feel you are likely to feel at ease with them. 

            Remember it is your time and space and it absolutely needs to feel like a relationship you feel safe and heard in.

            I chose to train in Person Centered Therapy as belive its provides the best opportunity to faciliate a space where 
            you feel at ease, and in your own time can begin to get to know yourself fully.  

            You may feel stuck, anxious or low.   Maybe you feel constanly afraid of letting others down, unsure of what you really want
            for yourself.  Trapped in a life that doesnt serve or fulfil you.

                   
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I have worked with adults from diverse backgrounds who 
            are dealing with issues such as anxiety, depression,grief, trauma, relationship difficulties, 
            substance misuse challenges and major life changes. 
            
            I have lots of experience working with adults who are neurodiverse and often work with clients who would 
            like to explore the interplay between their neurodiversity, identity and past life experiences.  

            Whatever your reasons for accessing therapy I aim to create the right space for you to feel we can 
            explore this together. 
    
            I hold a Diploma in Person Centered Counselling and am a member of the British
            Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). This means I
            work in accordance with BACP’s ethical framework to ensure the
            highest standards of professional practice. I engage in regular
            supervision and ongoing professional development to continually
            enhance my skills and knowledge.          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my counselling work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, 
            love open water swimming and continue to grow and develop my skills through ongoing learning and training.
