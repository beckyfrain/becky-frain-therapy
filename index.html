          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting <strong>Becky&nbsp;Frain&nbsp;Therapy</strong>. I hope my website answers any questions you may 
            have about who I am and the type of counselling I offer. 
            
            If you navigate through the menu you will find my fees, location of work and more about how I work. Counselling isn’t just for
            crises – it’s a chance to talk openly in a safe, non‑judgemental space and be heard by someone who will respect you and your opinions. During talking therapy, a trained counsellor listens and helps you find your own answers without judging.

          <h2>Why Choose Rebecca?</h2>
          <p>
            As a qualified counsellor and registered member of the British Association for Counselling &amp; Psychotherapy (BACP), I adhere to a ethical framework that puts your wellbeing, autonomy and confidentiality first.
            
            
            I am trained in Person Centered Therapy.    An approach that places you at the heart of counselling and offers a therapeutic 
            space without judgement.   The founder of Person Centered Therapy, Carl Rogers states: "We listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy.  Yet listening of this very special kind is one of the most potent
            forces for change that I know".   My aim is to create a space in your life for you to be really heard. warm, empathetic approach creates a welcoming atmosphere. where you can feel truly heard.
