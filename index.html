          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting <strong>Becky Frain Therapy</strong>. I hope my website answers any questions you may have about who I am and the type of counselling I offer. If you navigate through the menu you will find my fees, location of work and more about the type of therapy I offer.

          <p>
            Counselling isn’t just for crises – it’s a chance to talk openly in a safe, non‑judgemental space and be heard by someone who will respect you.

          <h2>Why choose Becky</h2>
          <p>
            As a qualified counsellor and registered member of the British Association for Counselling (BACP), I adhere to an ethical framework that puts your wellbeing, autonomy and confidentiality at the forefront of our work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am trained in Person Centered Therapy—an approach that places you at the heart of counselling and offers a therapeutic space without judgement. I have worked in mental health, substance misuse and with armed forces personnel. I have also worked with young neurodivergent adults and survivors of childhood abuse. I’m warm, friendly and aim to put you at ease quickly. If we work together we’ll have regular reviews to check how you’re experiencing counselling, and you’re free to end our work at any point if it doesn’t feel right.
          </p>
