<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What happens in a counselling session?</h3>
<p>Sessions provide a safe and confidential space for you to talk about your thoughts, feelings and experiences. I will listen, ask questions and help you explore what is happening for you. The goal is to help you gain insight and develop your own answers, rather than giving advice.</p>
<h3>How many sessions will I need?</h3>
<p>This varies for each person. Some people find a few sessions are enough, while others choose longer‑term therapy. We will regularly review your progress and decide together what feels right for you.</p>
<h3>Is counselling confidential?</h3>
<p>Everything you share with me is confidential. The only exceptions are if I believe there is a risk of serious harm to yourself or others, or if I am required to disclose information by law. I will explain confidentiality in more detail during our first session.</p>
<h3>How do I book an appointment?</h3>
<p>You can get in touch using the contact page or by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@beckyfraintherapy.com">contact@beckyfraintherapy.com</a>. I offer a free 20‑minute consultation so we can discuss what you are looking for and see whether we might work well together.</p>
<h3>How much will counselling cost?</h3><p>Sessions cost £50 for 50 minutes.</p><h3>Will my counsellor suggest or prescribe medication?</h3><p>No. Counsellors are not trained to prescribe medication. This is something to discuss with your GP. If you’re thinking about medication and feel unsure, you can use counselling to explore your feelings around it and/or prepare for that conversation with your GP, but I won’t advise what is best for you. Many counselling clients do not wish to access medication.</p><h3>Do I need to lie on a sofa during counselling sessions?</h3><p>No, absolutely not. Most clients sit for sessions; some stand and some prefer to walk around the room. You’re welcome to do what feels most comfortable for you—it certainly doesn’t involve the historic images where a therapist stands over someone lying on a couch!</p><h3>I’m a bit of a fidgeter / I struggle to make eye contact</h3><p>I encourage you to do whatever you need to feel at ease. You’re welcome to bring fidget toys and move around the room. I have no expectation around eye contact—whatever you’re comfortable with is fine with me.</p><h3>Can I access telephone‑based counselling if I’m not comfortable being seen on a video call?</h3><p>Yes—this is not uncommon. Some people feel more able to speak freely when they cannot be seen, which can be a real benefit of telephone‑based counselling.</p><p>If you have any questions that have not been answered here please feel free to get in touch. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a>.</p></div>
