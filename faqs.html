          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>What happens in a counselling session?</h3>
          <p>My sessions provide a safe and confidential space for you to talk about your thoughts, feelings and experiences. I will listen and help you explore what is happening for you. The goal is to help you gain insight and develop your own answers, rather than giving advice. For some people this can take time. We would work at the right pace and I will use my counselling skills to draw things into your awareness. Often, in or between sessions, clients have ‘lightbulb moments’ where they become aware of something meaningful and its impact on their life.</p>

          <h3>How many sessions will I need?</h3>
          <p>This varies for each person. Some people find that around six sessions is enough, while others choose longer‑term therapy. We will regularly review your progress and decide together what feels right for you. I will not ask you to commit to a number of sessions at the beginning—you will be in control of this.</p>

          <h3>Is counselling confidential?</h3>
          <p>Everything you share with me is confidential. The only exceptions are if I believe there is a risk of serious harm to yourself or others, or if I am required to disclose information by law. I will explain confidentiality in more detail during our first session and check you are happy to proceed.</p>

          <h3>How do I book an appointment?</h3>
          <p>You can get in touch using the contact page or by emailing <a href="mailto:Beckyfraintherapy@outlook.com">Beckyfraintherapy@outlook.com</a> or phone/text <strong>07721644794</strong>. You can also find me on Facebook—search ‘Becky Frain Therapy’. I offer a free 20‑minute consultation so we can discuss what you are looking for and see whether we might work well together. I offer in‑person sessions in Lymm, Warrington and Altrincham, and online sessions. I am also happy to discuss phone‑based counselling.</p>
